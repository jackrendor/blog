I'm Jack Rendor, a Cyber Security Enthusiast that loves creating scripts in Python and automate whatever task I can automate.

I currently have the eJPT and I'm aiming to get PNPT certified and then pass the eCCPTv2.

The main programming languages that I use are Python, Golang and Bash, but I also am familiar with C/C++ and PHP
